Contributing
============

Here's a quick list of tips for contributing to this project:

1. We follow the Tests Always Included [Style Guide].
2. You should make sure your editor uses [EditorConfig] so you can follow our whitespace rules easily. This is optional, but a convenient way to configure your editor to match our style.
3. Since this is shell code, please lint with [ShellCheck].

Thanks for helping out!
